The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for
TI 'TM4C1294NCPDT' microcontroller using TI 'EK-TM4C1294XL' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 25.00 MHz
   - SYS =  PIOSC     = 16.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. LEDs are blinking simulating the activity of the clock task.

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TM4C129 RAM:           configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  TM4C129 Flash:         configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
