The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
TI 'TM4C129XNCZAD' microcontroller using TI 'DK-TM4C129x' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 25.00 MHz
   - SYS =  PIOSC     = 16.00 MHz

 - 3 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if any Button (SW2, SW3) is pressed all LEDs are lit.
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART0
   UART0 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TM4C129 RAM:           configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  TM4C129 Flash:         configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
